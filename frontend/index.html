    <div id="zootext"><a>Ukrainian Zoo's have bad times during the war, their inhabitants may simply not survive due to lack of food😔️💔️. 
        I've created this NFT collection to support them, it's based on animals of Kyiv ZOO😺️. With this site, you can take your little digital animal from the zoo, 
        name it as you like and help the real ones.
    </a> <p><small>P.S. Also, name displays in the wallet, so it's like your digital pet :)</small></p> </div>
